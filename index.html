                    <h1>Outlander</h1>
                    <p>Outlander is a book series by Diana Gabaldon as well as a TV series on Starz, entering its sixth season. I fell in love with the series the first time I watched it. While I waited for new episodes to be released, I began to read the books. The books are massive and I just started the 8th book recently.</p>

                        <p>The series does a fairly good job of following the books and hits all the major plot points. Diana is a consultant on the show, and any changes to the plot are with her approval. It is a great mix of period drama and historical fiction, weaving the fictional story with real historcal events, as well as bringing in an element of fantasy: <span class="text">time travel</span>.</p>
