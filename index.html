                    <h1>Outlander</h1>
                    <p>Outlander is a book series by Diana Gabaldon as well as a TV series on Starz, entering its sixth season. I fell in love with the series the first time I watched it. While I waited for new episodes to be released, I began to read the books. The books are massive and I just started the 8th book recently.</p>

                    <h2>Book Series</h2>
                    <p>The book series currently has 8 books published with the much anticipated 9th book in the series releasing in <span class="text">November 2021</span>. There are also several companion novels and novellas. I read one of the campanion pieces, which was a collection of side stories, before I had finished reading the novels, and the way these companion pieces complement the full work is amazing. </p>

                    <h2>TV Series</h2>
                    <p>The series does a fairly good job of following the books and hits all the major plot points. Diana is a consultant on the show, and any changes to the plot are with her approval. It is a great mix of period drama and historical fiction, weaving the fictional story with real historcal events, as well as bringing in an element of fantasy: <span class="text">time travel</span>.</p>
